Topic: Data Types in Java
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data types specify the different sizes and values that can be stored in the variable. 
There are two types of data types in Java:

1. Primitive data types: The primitive data types include boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, 
float and double.
2. Non-primitive data types: The non-primitive data types include Classes, Interfaces, and Arrays.

Java Primitive Data Types
In Java language, primitive data types are the building blocks of data manipulation. These are 
the most basic data types available in Java language.

Java is a statically-typed programming language. It means, all variables must be declared 
before its use. That is why we need to declare variable's type and name.

There are 8 types of primitive data types:

1. boolean data type
2. byte data type
3. char data type
4. short data type
5. int data type
6. long data type
7. float data type
8. double data type
