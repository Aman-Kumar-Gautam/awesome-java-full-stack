Class Upcasting : Here we create parent class reference variable & store child class 
objects address into it,
  
Class upcasting results in reusing of reference variable,

A a1 = new B(); // create a variable for reference of A 
class 
In this 
now a1 will hold the reference address of class A

Class Down-Casting: Here we create child class variable & store parent class objects
address into it. 
B b1 = (B)new A(); // create a variable for reference of class B
here
